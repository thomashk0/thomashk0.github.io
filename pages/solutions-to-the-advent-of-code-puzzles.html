<h1>Solutions to the Advent of Code Puzzles</h1>
<p>We are December 1st, the clock is displaying 5:59AM a temporal vortex is about to pop...
The first <a class="reference external" href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> (AoC) puzzle unlocks!</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with it, this event is an <cite>Advent Calendar &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar&gt;</cite> where each day, a new puzzle unlocks.
Puzzles are indented to be solved through programming, but you can go with your pen and paper, an FPGA or your Excel spreadsheets (insane!).
AoC is not like any other programming contest.
Besides the problems themselves, the things I like the most in AoC, are all the small stories around the puzzles and the care with which the problem are interleaved.
The first days usually start cool and then, difficulty ramp up until December 25th.
Usually week-end problems are much harder (under the assumption that people have more time to solve them).
Furthermore, topics are mixed carefuly so that the problem do not become boring.</p>
<p>They are not especially hard mathematical or algorithmic</p>
<!-- Solving these puzzle not only very fun, but it feels like getting back to school -->
<p>Just a small warning: if like me, you are not a competitive programmer, say goodbye to your spare time in December!
Easy problems generally take me around 30 minutes, while some of the most complex took me from 1 to 8 hours.</p>
<p>Perhaps in order to motivate people to try it, I decided to highlight a few funny problems.</p>
<div class="section" id="tips">
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p><strong>Languages.</strong> In 2018, I did most of the puzzles in C++.
It was painful, I spend so much time struggling with the language, rather than on the problems themselves.
In 2019 and 2020 I switched mostly into Python, basically it divided my solving time by 2.
When I feel that the problem would benefit from strong typing, I switch to something like Rust.</p>
